/*
For some reason, the change() event only fires when the input field loses focus.
Binding to other options ('change keypress paste focus textInput input') will 
fire the event several times, which is bad. The below code works even when 
content is pasted into the text field, and only fires once as expected.

$('#search-form .term').bind('input', function(){
  console.log('this actually works');
});

HTML example:
<form id="search-form">
  <input type="text" class="term" name="Search" value="Search" autocomplete="off" />
  <input type="submit" name="Search" value="Search" />
</form>
